# LoCoS

- Professor [[Yukio Ota]] is the designer of the International Emergency Exit Symbol and of a construct language called LoCoS
- [[LoCoS]] is a pictoral language designed to be intuitive and effortless to pick up, and emphasizes "the importance of communication among all the people of all the countries of the world."
- It's composed of basic building blocks in the form of simple shapes that represent an idea. These can be combined to create new symbols for more complex ideas.
- Once you know the base, related symbols are easy to understand and remember.
- LoCoS is written from left to right and Professor [[Yukio Ota]] prefers writing it in a three-line arrangement, allowing readers to make up their own minds about the best order to interpret the symbols. However it can also be written in a single link  for the sake of saving space and faster reading.
- Questions on LoCoS
    - Is there a place for LoCoS as a universal language?
        - English is to many speakers a foreign language. 
        - Above that, translation software typically translates from one language to another via English, leading to inaccurate translations as the text complexity increases. 
        - A shared language closes the gap between people and eliminates the need for a translator.
        - The grammar could even unify the many symbols sets existing across countries.
    - Is the experience of reading visual symbols inherently different to reading spelled words?
        - LoCoS could be an accessible first written language for people learning to read and write. It could be useful in countries where people have limited access to education or where many languages are spoken
    - Can visual symbols be as nuanced and expressive as text?
        - Readers and writers of Chinese characters will attests that conceptual symbols can be just as profound or nuanced as any form of phonetic writing.
