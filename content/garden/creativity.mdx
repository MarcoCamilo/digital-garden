# About Creativity

Creativity is combinatorial. Nothing is entirely original, but builds on what came before. We create by taking existing pieces of inspiration, knowledge, skill, and insight that we gather over the course of our lives and recombining them into incredible new creations.

Combinational creativity is the process of combining old ideas to come up with something new

Originality isn't something you start with: it's an emergent property of studying other people's ideas—an intellectual phase transition.

"The task is not so much to see what no one has yet seen, but to think what nobody yet has thought about that which everybody sees." —Arthur Schopenhauer
