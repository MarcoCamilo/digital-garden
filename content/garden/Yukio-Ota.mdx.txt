# Yukio Ota

Professor [[Yukio Ota]] is the designer of the International Emergency Exit Symbol and of a construct language called [[LoCoS]].

Yukio Ota is captivated by symbols. He has dedicated his life to them, and he becomes energised when he talks about them. Professor Ota’s emergency exit symbol is recognised around the world. But his life’s work is something much more ambitious: an entire language of symbols which he dreams could be the lingua franca of the 21st Century.

Professor Ota began designing LoCoS in 1964. I get the sense that his devotion to the project comes from the joy of creating. LoCoS is an inviting world to inhabit: one of smiling hearts, delightful symbols and elegant simplicity.
