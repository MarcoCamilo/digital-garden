# Welcome to my Mind Garden!

A metaphor for writing and creativity that focuses less on the result and more on the process of creation.

I'm [Marco Camilo](https://marcocamilo.com)

Welcome to my Mind Garden, a collection of atomic notes, serendipitous thoughts, reading notes, writing ideas, and seed of curiosity. Here you'll find growing seedlings that'll one day bare fruit in a future article.

Notes here are organized and interconnected as a web, but with a touch of caos to foster creative connections.

Inspired by by [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), and Joel Hooks' [digital garden manifesto](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), this space might be:
- A daily knowledge journal: a curated source of my daily insights through reading and writing.
- An idea garden: a space where curiosity matures into insight.
- An asynchronous conversation with ideas: a slow and growing interaction between ideas and thought.

My mind garden is an attempt to learn in public. To share my process through the notes that testify my discoveries. To give my ideas a space where they can live as they are and be accessed by those who through curiosity stumbled upon them: like you!

There's no index to all the hidden discoveries here. You'll have to navigate this garden with a starting point of your choosing. If you read my content, it might be for one (or all) of these topics: language, mindful productivity, metalearning. 

From here, the journey's up to you. Enjoy!
