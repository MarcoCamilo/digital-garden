# Journaling

-  Zuihitsu (随筆) is a genre of Japanese literature. The name is derived from two words: “pen” and “at will.”
- Authors write what’s top of mind and follow their random thoughts. 
- The genre is more personal than performative and gives the reader an intimate look at the inner workings of the writer’s mind. The subject matter is typically filled with fragmented ideas that respond to the author’s surroundings. [[writing]]
