# Writing

Writing, like many other crafts, is a process of discovery. 

Only by going through the process of compression can one find ultimate distillation.

Clarity comes from knowing your topic and excellent essay organization. This often comes from creating a good outline before your first. Brevity is quite obviously achieved by getting to the point as quickly as you can. This keeps readers engaged and breezing through your work without a second thought.

Drafting is all about clearing our mind of all the initial thoughts about our topic and making sure we have enough building blocks to organize into a good final edition.
